Section 1
To address - Branding - in case you want to revisit the existing branding. Logo or brand guidelines.


1. What is the raison d’etre or reason for being for the brand?


RektCEO exists to channel that rebellious energy of getting “rekt” into a creative and collaborative movement that empowers individuals to become the CEOs of their own lives.


* For the rekt. By the rekt. Your turn to win[a]
* Turning Memes into movements. And degens into CEOs
* It takes a while for someone to realise that everything that they are told to follow meticulously in order to “win” at life, is nothing but a crafted narrative by the big money. Big money that lives on beating down the small money, that beating essentially strips you of your own agency[b]. Getting rekt is at the crossroad of that revelation, every time you are down, is a wake up call to take on your own agency and escape this matrix.




Revive - 
You believed … not your fault 

“RektCEO exists to transform the rebellious energy of getting “rekt” into a creative, collaborative movement—one that empowers individuals to become the CEOs of their own lives.
For the rekt. By the rekt.
 It’s your turn to win.
Turning memes into movements, and degens into CEOs.
Most people spend years chasing the formula they were told would help them “win” at life. But that formula is a carefully crafted narrative—designed by big money, for big money. It thrives on beating down the small players, stripping them of agency, ambition, and control.
Getting rekt sits right at the crossroads of that realization. Every downfall isn’t a failure—it’s a wake-up call. A moment of clarity that pushes you to reclaim your agency, break out of the matrix, and rewrite your own narrative.
RektCEO is the culture of rising stronger.
Of turning losses into leverage.
Of becoming the CEO of you.
”




2. How would you define the higher ground or purpose for the brand?


RektCEO aims to convert rekt moments into collective rocket fuel, liberating us from a rigged system and architect a new, community owned world, where everyone can thrive.


Our roles in this society and community shouldn’t be defined by where am I born, how much do I earn, whom do I know… it should be open for everyone to make, discover, ideate, maintain … for the right people for the right reasons.


Exiting the sophisticated pyramid of wealth extraction


“RektCEO exists to transform personal losses and “rekt” moments into collective rocket fuel. We are here to liberate individuals from a rigged, hierarchical system designed to extract wealth, restrict autonomy, and reward privilege over merit.
Our purpose is to architect a new, community-owned world—one where opportunity isn’t limited by birth, income, access, or who you happen to know. In this world, roles are earned through creativity, contribution, discovery, and the courage to build. It’s about elevating the right people for the right reasons, not the richest people for the wrong ones.
RektCEO stands for exiting the sophisticated pyramid of wealth extraction and reclaiming agency. By empowering degens, dreamers, and doers to become the CEOs of their own lives, we shift culture from passive consumption to active creation.
The higher ground is simple:
A future where everyone can thrive—not because the system allowed it, but because the community built it.[c]
”


3. How would you define your ideal customer?


The Rekt Renegades: The protagonist of our story. Crypto native degens, who have been in the trenches. 
You got rekt, not because you are dumb/degen as the media labels it, you got rekt because you were smart enough to understand a vision and brave enough to venture on it, too bad the ones who showed you the vision didn’t really believe in it.( funnily enough because everyone is a ceo, you can be vision bearer)
