REKT CEO | INTRO
REKT CEO | INTRODUCTION

Learn, Earn and Have Fun 🎉

STORY


I was a meme guy once.
I spent hours scrolling through crypto twitter and discord, laughing at jokes that hit too close to home.
Like every other degen, I aped into memecoins hyped by influencers, hoping to turn my crumbs into millions. Guess what?
The market turned, and my bags? Worth less than gas fees to sell. 

I was rekt

But I wasn’t done. I doubled down, learned the game, and stopped chasing every moonshot. I found projects with purpose, a strong community, and real vibes. Slowly but surely, my memes turned into dreams. Now, I’m not just holding bags—I’m holding the future. A community that laughs, learns, and grows together. Because let’s face it:

✅We’re all here to make money
✅We’re all here to have fun.
✅We’re all here to belong

A decentralised community where we stick together, innovate, and turn cool ideas into reality. We’re all been rekt at some point - don’t let it define you. Trust your gut, back yourself, and enjoy the ride.


NO Insiders, NO KOLs and NO Bullshit
Pure Decentralised Community






CONCEPT
Rekt Ceo builds a robust community while solving the “what to do with your coin” problem, and having fun along with art and memes. With the help of community and decentralisation we are creating a “BRAND” native to web3 but not limited to digital space.


We provide experience and entertainment with meme coins, and enable an ecosystem of products and services incubating community ideas and taking us forward with the help of memes.


A fair launch mechanism for the community with NO INSIDERS, NO KOLS, NO BULLSHIT. Every $CEO[a] holder is a co-founder member of the community.







OUR FOCUS
Website
Unlike other web3 projects we aim to enable our website for all the web3 activities. In time you’ll see so many things to do with your $CEO tokens, on our website. No distributed communication channels and No centralised decision making.


We enable 2 limited products at the launch[b][c]:
1. PFP minter (Collection): Users can design their pfp themselves and own them by minting as limited NFTs (only 2 per user).
   1. Only minted using $ceo tokens: increasing $ceo token demand.
   2. Creative engagement for users: feel belonging to the community, having fun.
   3. Sharable Experience: Organic Marketing
   4. Funds accumulated in community treasury: building up funds to invest in community ideas.


2. Meme Generator Collection): Users can create memes, share and own them by minting as limited NFTs
   1. Only minted using $ceo tokens:  increasing $ceo token demand.
   2. Creative Engagement for users: Feel Belonged, Have fun
   3. Sharable Experience: Organic Marketing (Memes inherently contain trending potential)
   4. Funds accumulated in community treasury
   5. Users own the IP of their trending creation.[d][e]










Roadmap
We aim to bring many necessary products in future, while opening the gates for community innovation/ development. 
1. Telegram/ Discord inspired chatbox for community with inbuilt intuitive DAO mechanism for easy decentralised decision making.
2. Community Treasury Dashboard with funds generated from above first 2 products, and future products.
3. Create a Donation box for IRL Clubhouse and IRL party.
4. REKT CEO Merchandise
5. Community Driven Investment Funds.
6. SubDAOs in various domains: tech, games, marketing, influencership, trading, job hunting, art, music, culture, travelling, sports, and much more.






$CEO token Launch
We launch with a fair and unique market mechanism on Exchange1 to attract the already present meme community. 


1. Dev wallet minting 1-3% token supply
2. Using that 1-3% supply, we create $CEO/ USDC market on Exchange2
3. Lock liquidity for 1 year and earn LP fee.[f][g][h]


This creates a very engaging market participation for users, as you can:
1. Trade tokens using ETH on Exchange1 or using USDC on Exchange2.
2. Become LP by staking $CEO/ETH or  $CEO/ USDC on Exchange1 or Exchange2, just like our dev wallet and earn passive income.[i][j]
3. Search for arbitrage between markets and extract volatility value.


To create a successful launch, we may enable artificial volume until the community takes over by solid regular volume. [k][l]


All the investors get a chance to:
1. Earn Big Money by engaging with $CEO tokens
2. Have Fun by creating PFP and MEMEs[m][n][o]
3. Belong to a community with unlimited potential tod innovative ideas.[p][q]




Social Media Marketing
* Twitter : @rekt_ceo
   * Regular content creation by team
   * Auto share users created pfp and memes on socials
* Telegram: Maybe
* Bring Telegram on the website by building a public chatbox enabled by holding $ceo tokens/ NFTs and engaging in an intuitive decentralised based decision making process for future development of the project.[r]
* QuestN/ Galaxy Campaigns
* Farcaster/ Lens presence


* Plan 30 days content with memes/ campaigns and more before launching
* Need 1 full time community manager.




Memecoin Supercycle thesis

1. Pyramid of Sophisticated Wealth Extraction
1. Founders  (zero cost basis)
2. VC, Angels,- (get to buy large % of token cheaply)
3. Exchanges, Market Maker (Get Token Supply + $$ to list the token)
4. Twitter KOLs, Telegram Callers, Youtubers (get token to talk about token)
5. CT Traders - scalp trade
6. Retail are the Exit Liquidity






2. Why is the memecoin cycle happening?
2.1 Internal Reason to Crypto Industry
1. Massive over production of tokens
2. Extremely inflated altcoin valuations at TGE/ CEX listing time
3. All the altcoin price appreciation has been relegated to the private rounds
4. All 2024 token launches on binance are literally down only.
5. 99.99% of altcoins don;t produce revenues which justify their valuations
6. Crypto token market don;t seem to value revenue as much as [s]hype.
7. Gigantic amount of Unlocks that are yet to unlock in the coming years.[t][u]
8. Memecoins proven themselves with DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, WIF


Token is the Real Product


Crypto Industry is the token production industry masquerading as a software production industry.


The entire token market can’t sustain itself without retail inflows
But the vast majority of retail never cared about the Tech.
Why would they ?






What does retail actually care about ?
NO
1. Blockchain being slightly faster
2. Blockchain being a bit more private 
3. Zk snark cryptography
YES
1. 70%- Making Money 
2. 20% -Having Fun
3. 10% belonging somewhere 


Memecoins are not a Vampire attack against Crypto Tech.
Memecoins are a Vampire attack against Crypto Tech TOKENS[v][w]




Both memecoins and altcoins are selling you same thing: TOKEN


Memecoins are counter attack of the “Trenches”
All tokens (Tech and Meme) are tables at the casino.


Why should we play at your tables, when we can have our own tables?


Memecoins are a reincarnation of 2017 ICO wave, in a new form.


Crypto “Tech” projects that managed to create cult-like communities and outperformed for a long period of time were those that had an ICO or another way of letting retail buy CHEAP before a major run up.




Why does this matter?


When you are trading attention - a relentless community is the “Secret Sauce” that you need to look for.




If Poor people don;t get rich = You have no community.
P.s. airdrop don’t build community.[x]








2.2 External Reasons to Crypto Industry
1. Accelerating price of everyday goods.
2. Accelerating AI capabilities coming for your jobs
3. Wealth & Income inequality
4. Loneliness, sexlessness, mental health issues
5. Amount of time spent online 
6. Competitiveness; few remaining ways to make it
7. Diminishing influence of Religion in Society
8. Crisis of Meaning


All of the Above are bullish crypto, but especially Memecoins…[y][z][aa]




Stories create Trends


For trends to emerge, there need to be stories percolating across the Industry (and society at large) about people making large gains.


Where are stories coming from this cycle?
Several famous stories with $PEPE, $BONK, $WIF.


Importance of Momentum
Trends early in the cycle end up going parabolic in the end of the cycle
Explanation: Momentum + Reflexivity + Stories
Strength begets strength


Altcoins $850B
Altcoin Unlocks (2024-2029) $155B
Memes $40B


Every cycle, the Cryptoasset category that outperforms the most is one that us “new, weird and misunderstood”.


Parabolas are more likely to occur in Assets that are difficult to Value


With each cycle -> the main altcoin narrative is becoming “Crazier”
Murad Mahmudov’s Theory is that this is a byproduct of inflationary pressures in Society and its collective Mental + Hormonal well being.


Anxiety pushes “the Swarm” further down the Risk Curve.


Altcoins working on 3 products
1. Software
2. Community 
3. Token
Memecoins working on 2 products
1. Community
2. Token


People do not need tech, or even a promise of future dividends to purchase a crypto coin.
All they need is to like it.
And see people talking about it.


What are people talking about the most on Crypto Twitter this cycle ?


Memecoin Utility
Many VCs and thought leaders claim that memecoins don;t have utility.


Best Memecoins have more utility than almost all Tech Alts.[ab][ac]


* Having fun
* Loneliness reduction
* Identity, finding similar crew
* Hope provisioning
* Friendship
* Being part of cutting edge culture
* Sense of belongingness
* A guild in the MMORPG that is crypto
* Experience of Teamwork
* Greater sense of Participation and Contribution compared to Software Alts.
* Relatibility + Emotional Connection
* Mission + Meaning
* Entertainment + Being Happy
* Charity
* Collective Artistic Expression
* Collective Imagined Reality
* StoryTelling and Lore building
* Defying Social Norms
* Volatility aka trading vehicle aka the token


It doesn’t matter that there is No Revenue
People are paying for these “Services” and participating…
… by buying the Token.
This also applies to Altcoins as well.
Memes just do it better due to structural, tokenomic and emotional reasons.


Altcoins aren’t primarily about Tech
Memecoins aren’t primarily about Memes


Both are simply Tokenized Communities using different narratives and techniques to recruit people and get the price to go up.


  







What Actually matters
* Community
* Poor people getting rich
* Perceived Maximum Upside
* Attention
* Fairness
* Organic Price Discovery
* Eliminating Class Warfare/ Bitterness
* No Unlocks
* No Supply Overhung
* Focusing on new Coins
* Avoiding Old Coins (Bagholders)
* Price Action
* Positive Momentum
* Evangelism + Community Participation
* Where can you buy it ?
* Authenticity
* No VCs No Cabals 
* Where the Whales are
* Who the KOLs are
* Who is talking about this on Social Media?
* The Concept/ The Meme
* Price Action
* Positive Momentum
* The Message
* Decentralization
* Cultiness
* People Not Selling
* Emotion
* A good story
* Fresh Narrative
* Authenticity
* Inspiration
* Trends
* Participation Stickiness
* Free Cult Labour


You are focused on Technology


The Crypto Industry is not a Technology - First industry
It is an Asset First Industry


Instead of Tech, focus on Human Condition, Retail Motivation, and Asset Distribution.


Memecoins are here to Stay


  
[ad][ae][af]




Most retail don’t want to Gamble and constantly rotate.
They want to BUY and HOLD something they resonate with.




Memecoin: 30% about the Meme, 70% about the People.
Memecoins are Tokenized Communities which use the Meme as their symbol/ their Banner/ their Philosophy.


Different Communities = Different Flavours.


The best PvE Memecoins becomes CULTS


Religion is losing influence around the World, and Brands, Experiences & Communities are filling the Void.




More than just Money
Think about total Human Resources in aggregate
* Human Money
* Human Attention
* Human Time
* Human Energy
* Human Labor


Attention will be dominated by Cryptoassets where not only retail money + attention, but also retail time, energy and labour is channeled.


No Community = Your token is Dead.




Why is being a Cult desirable?
* Cult coins will trade at a huge premium
* Cult = Diamond hands = people not selling
* Participation Stickiness
* Army of Schizos working for the coin 24/7
* Free cult labour = holders (engineer, designers, influencers) providing Labor for FREE.




  





NFTs vs Memecoins
* Memecoins will go much much higher than NFTs
* Instead of 3000 people promoting 10,000 illiquid JPEGs, you now have 100,000 people promoting 1 single liquid token.
* Infinitely more effective and efficient.




How to Value Memecoins?
* Not equity
* Not debt
* Not currencies
* No future revenue promise.




BEST memecoins are 
* emerging mini-religions and need to be analyzed as such.
* They are financial vessels of Faith
* Vessels collecting Dissatisfaction (both with “Tech Crypto” and the world at large)




Next Evolution: Cults → Movements
* Inspiration
* Meme coins = Financialized Middle- Finger to crypto
* Movement Coins = Financialized Middle Finger to the World.


Memecoins = Simple
Tech Alts = Complex


Ironically, memecoins will bring more new people to crypto than any other cryptoasset category.






Putting All Together, memecoins are:
* Simpler than Tech Alts
* More liquid than NFTs
* Safer than Defi
* No inflation (all tokens fully circulating)
* No VC dumping, No Unlocks
* Better odds than Sports betting & Casinos
* More volatility (excitement) than altcoins
* Fresh narrative
* Give retail a chance to win
* Most passionate and loudest communities in crypto


Best crypto Products don’t require a Token
*  Pump Fun[ag][ah], Polymarket, Fantasy Top, Phantom, etc.


Best Crypto Tokens don;t require a Product
* WIF, POPCAT, PEPE, GIGA, etc.

Inspiration: Riding the Memecoin Supercycle
The memecoin revolution isn’t just another passing trend; it’s the crypto market’s purest expression of what retail truly desires: making money, having fun, and belonging to a tribe. Projects like $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE proved that tokens don’t need complex tech or inflated promises to succeed—what they need is a relentless community, a good story, and momentum.
Problem: The “Pyramid of Sophisticated Wealth Extraction”
The crypto industry today thrives on a system where:
        •        Founders mint tokens at zero cost.
        •        VCs and Angels buy in early at discounts.
        •        Exchanges and KOLs profit from hype and token listings.
        •        Retail is left holding the bag.

In contrast, memecoins flip this narrative. They’re community-first, allowing retail to actively participate in building the story and reaping the rewards, rather than serving as exit liquidity.

Why Memecoins Are Dominating
        1.        Internal Market Dynamics
        •        The overproduction of tokens and inflated valuations have made most altcoins unattractive.
        •        Memecoins, however, tap into human emotions and retail motivations, creating value through memes, community, and shared experiences—not overpromised tech.
        2.        External Socioeconomic Trends
        •        Rising economic inequality, loneliness, and societal disenchantment have created a void that memecoins are uniquely positioned to fill.
        •        They provide hope, fun, and a sense of belonging, acting as a counterattack to the exploitative practices of traditional crypto.


Vision: A Community-Driven Ecosystem
Rekt CEO is not just a memecoin; it’s a movement. Born from the pain of “getting rekt” in the market, it aims to unite those who’ve been burned by the system into a decentralized, self-sustaining tribe. Our mission is to create a space where:
        •        No one is an insider.
        •        No one is left behind.
        •        Everyone is a CEO.


What Sets Us Apart:
        1.        Tokenized Fairness: No VC allocations, no private sales, and no unlock schedules. Every $CEO token holder starts on equal footing, fostering organic price discovery and eliminating class warfare.
        2.        Built for Retail
        •        The $CEO token is simple, fun, and liquid, designed for retail investors who resonate with its story and want to hold long-term.
        •        Whether you’re minting NFTs, generating memes, or trading tokens, our platform ensures engagement, fun, and financial opportunity.
        3.        A Cult-Like Community: At its core, $CEO is about the people. The best memes coins thrive because they build cults:
        •        Diamond hands = price stability.
        •        Participation stickiness = free labor.
        •        Shared identity = relentless evangelism.
        4.        Evolving Utility: At launch, we provide PFP minting and a meme generator. Future upgrades, governed by the community, include:
        •        Treasury dashboards.
        •        IRL events.
        •        DAO-enabled chatboxes.
        •        Merchandise and community funds.


Why $CEO?
Rekt CEO is more than a token; it’s a symbol. A banner for those who’ve been wrecked and want to rise again. It’s for those who believe that the token is the product, and that memes are the language of the future.

Business Proposal: Strategic Partnership with REKT CEO Project
To: Friends and Partners
This proposal outlines a compelling strategic opportunity for you to engage with the "REKT CEO" project, a community-driven memecoin initiative poised to capitalize on the current memecoin supercycle. By analyzing the market landscape through the lens of Porter's Five Forces, we demonstrate the unique positioning and value proposition of REKT CEO, highlighting its alignment with your interests in web3 portfolio expansion, exposure, and community leveraging.
1. Introduction to REKT CEO: A Community-First Movement
The REKT CEO project emerged from the shared experience of crypto enthusiasts who have faced market setbacks, aiming to unite those "rekt" by the system into a decentralized, self-sustaining tribe. Its core philosophy centers on "Learn, Earn and Have Fun," directly addressing the fundamental desires of retail crypto participants: making money, having fun, and belonging to a tribe.
Key aspects of the REKT CEO project include:
* A vision for a decentralized community that innovates and turns ideas into reality, emphasizing "NO Insiders, NO KOLs and NO Bullshit". Every $CEO holder is considered a co-founder member.
* It solves the "what to do with your coin" problem by building a robust community, providing experience and entertainment through art and memes, and incubating community ideas.
* It aims to create a "BRAND native to web3" but not limited to the digital space.
* Initial product offerings include a PFP minter (Collection) and a Meme Generator (Collection). Both products require $CEO tokens for minting, increasing token demand, fostering creative engagement, and facilitating organic marketing through shareable experiences. Funds from these activities accumulate in a community treasury.
* The project has an ambitious roadmap, including a Telegram/Discord-inspired chatbox with an inbuilt DAO mechanism for decentralized decision-making, a community treasury dashboard, donation boxes for IRL Clubhouses and parties, merchandise, community-driven investment funds, and SubDAOs.
* The $CEO token will launch with a fair and unique market mechanism via a Bonding Curve, ensuring transparent and fair price discovery without insider advantage or centralized control.
* All investors get a chance to earn big money by engaging with $CEO tokens, have fun by creating PFPs and memes, and belong to a community with unlimited potential.
2. Porter's Five Forces Analysis of the Memecoin Market (REKT CEO's Context)
While Porter's Five Forces is typically applied to traditional industries, we can adapt it to understand the competitive dynamics surrounding REKT CEO within the broader crypto market, particularly the memecoin sector.
2.1. Threat of New Entrants: High (but with nuances for success)
The ease of creating a new token or smart contract means the technical barrier to entry is very low. The crypto industry is characterized by a "massive over production of tokens".
However, for a memecoin to succeed and become a "cult," as REKT CEO aims to be, the barrier to entry shifts from technical to community-building and authentic engagement. The sources emphasize that "Poor people don't get rich = You have no community" and that "airdrop don't build community". REKT CEO's "NO Insiders, NO KOLs and NO Bullshit" philosophy and fair launch mechanism are designed to foster organic, cult-like community, which is a much higher barrier for new entrants to replicate authentically. This focus on "Tokenized Fairness" and "organic price discovery" differentiates it.
2.2. Bargaining Power of Buyers (Retail Investors): High (and intentionally empowered by REKT CEO)
In the traditional "Pyramid of Sophisticated Wealth Extraction," retail investors are often the "Exit Liquidity". This gives buyers (retail) high power because they are the ultimate source of demand and capital for project founders and VCs.
Memecoins like REKT CEO directly empower retail buyers, fundamentally shifting this dynamic. They are a "counter attack of the 'Trenches'", allowing retail to actively participate in building the story and reaping rewards. REKT CEO is "Built for Retail", focusing on what retail actually cares about: making money (70%), having fun (20%), and belonging somewhere (10%). By making every $CEO holder a "co-founder member" and ensuring "no VCs, no private rounds, no gatekeepers", REKT CEO significantly increases the buyer's perceived fairness and stake, converting them from mere buyers into active participants and "free cult labour".
2.3. Bargaining Power of Suppliers (e.g., Developers, Liquidity Providers, Platforms): Moderate to Low (controlled by decentralization)
* Developers/Team: The "Rekt CEO" project aims for community innovation and development. While there's an initial budget for a community manager, core team members are compensated with "Token Equity", reducing initial cash outlays and aligning incentives with the project's success. The ultimate goal is for "free cult labour = holders (engineer, designers, influencers) providing Labor for FREE".
* Liquidity Providers: REKT CEO plans to create initial liquidity pools ($CEO/USDC on Exchange2, $CEO/ETH on Exchange1) using a small dev wallet supply and earn LP fees. The "Revenue Calculation" indicates that accumulated funds will be dynamically rebalanced into 50% stablecoin and 50% $CEO, partly for "Liquidity Rebalancing". This internal mechanism and the ability for users to "Become LP" help mitigate supplier power.
* Platforms (Exchanges): The project plans to launch on "Exchange1" and "Exchange2", and considers popular DEXs like PancakeSwap/Uniswap. While exchanges hold listing power, the memecoin supercycle emphasizes the token as the product, and the community as the primary driver of value, potentially lessening reliance on centralized exchange listings. The project also aims to bring Telegram on its website with a chatbox "enabled by holding $ceo tokens/ NFTs", reducing reliance on external chat platforms.
2.4. Threat of Substitute Products or Services: High (but REKT CEO offers unique utility)
The crypto market offers numerous substitutes for investment and engagement, including:
* Traditional "Tech Alts": These projects claim to offer "software" and "technology" as their primary product. However, the sources argue that 99.99% of altcoins don't produce revenues justifying their valuations and are often "down only".
* NFTs: While NFTs offer ownership of digital assets, memecoins are seen as "infinitely more effective and efficient" for promotion and liquidity, with "100,000 people promoting 1 single liquid token" versus 3,000 people promoting 10,000 illiquid JPEGs.
* DeFi, Sports Betting, Casinos: Memecoins are presented as "safer than Defi" and offering "better odds than Sports betting & Casinos".
REKT CEO (and memecoins generally) counter these threats by offering a different kind of "utility":
* Emotional and Social Utility: "Having fun, loneliness reduction, identity, finding similar crew, hope provisioning, friendship, sense of belongingness, and collective artistic expression". People are "paying for these 'Services' and participating… by buying the Token".
* Simplicity and Accessibility: Memecoins are "Simpler than Tech Alts" and "More liquid than NFTs".
* Direct Engagement: REKT CEO's PFP minter and Meme Generator provide immediate, creative utility that directly aligns with "having fun" and "creative engagement".
* A "Movement": REKT CEO is positioned as a "movement" and a "Financialized Middle-Finger to crypto" and "to the World," resonating with external socioeconomic trends like wealth inequality and loneliness.
2.5. Intensity of Rivalry: High (but differentiation by "cult" building)
The crypto market is highly competitive, with a "gigantic amount of Unlocks" and many altcoins failing to retain value. "Massive over production of tokens" contributes to this rivalry.
However, REKT CEO differentiates itself by focusing on building a "cult-like community", aiming for "PvE Memecoins" (aka "Cults") that prioritize "HODL > Trading," building a brand and a movement, and achieving a "High % of Supply in Diamond Hands". This contrasts with "PvP Memecoins" (aka "Hypergambling") driven by paid KOLs and constant rotation.
REKT CEO explicitly addresses the "Pyramid of Sophisticated Wealth Extraction" problem, positioning itself as a counter-narrative against the traditional crypto industry's exploitative practices, which gives it a unique competitive stance. Its fair launch and community-driven approach minimize internal class warfare, focusing on collective success.



3. Strategic Rationale for Cosx.ai: Leveraging the REKT CEO Opportunity
The "COSX pov" section directly highlights the strategic advantages for Cosx.ai in engaging with the REKT CEO project:
* Portfolio Diversification and Addition: REKT CEO represents a valuable addition to Cosx's portfolio products in the web3 space. This includes exposure to:

   * A strong community.
   * An ERC20 fungible token ($CEO).
   * Two NFT collections (PFP and Meme NFTs).
   * A "crazy DAO concept nobody thought of till now" in the roadmap, offering unique governance and participation models.
   * The potential to organize events and enable Cosx tech House as part of the roadmap.
   * Building Exposure and Knowledge Transfer: Engagement with REKT CEO provides building exposure and knowledge transfer to the Cosx team. This can be achieved through:

      * Holding $CEO tokens.
      * Holding REKT CEO NFTs.
      * Gated access to community channels, allowing Cosx to observe and learn from the project's community dynamics and development.
      * Potential for Inbound Reach-out: A successful launch of the REKT CEO project could lead to inbound reach-out opportunities for Cosx, enhancing its reputation and network within the web3 space.

      * High Growth Potential: The crypto community space, particularly for projects with strong community backing, offers significant upside, with the source noting that "x10 is very easy in crypto community space".

      * Indirect Benefits Through Community Access: By engaging with the REKT CEO community, Cosx gains access to global human and monetary resources. This includes access to smart people within the community and the future ability to plug any idea into the DAO/Community to lift off a pilot. This suggests a collaborative ecosystem where Cosx could potentially test and develop new initiatives with the support of a passionate and engaged community.

4. Conclusion
The REKT CEO project is strategically positioned within the current memecoin supercycle, offering simplicity, high liquidity, safety, and a unique opportunity for retail participation. Its explicit focus on building a cult-like community and providing emotional and social utility directly addresses the core motivations of crypto retail.
For Cosx.ai, aligning with REKT CEO represents a compelling opportunity to diversify its web3 portfolio, gain valuable exposure and knowledge, and tap into a vibrant, engaged community for future collaborative endeavors. By investing in and supporting this project, Cosx.ai can directly benefit from a movement that embodies the true desires of the modern crypto participant: to make money, have fun, and belong to a tribe.
REKT CEO is more than a token; it’s a symbol – a banner for those who’ve been "wrecked" and want to rise again, embodying the core desires of the crypto retail market. Joining this movement presents a compelling pathway for Cosx.ai to expand its influence and impact within the evolving web3 landscape.

Appendix
Version 1 (personal)


What do I want?

Since my childhood I wanted to become the richest person (of the world), even till my graduation I had the same goal. 
I remember shouting this in front of my university peers.

Our school systems do not have money in our curriculum, yet our lives depend on it.
We spend most of our lives worrying about it, working for it, saving it, spending it, and even fighting, dying, or killing for it. It defines our social status and even compromises our morals.


But is that all? Is money the only thing that defines a person?

NO! 
I believe what matters more is the work that you did in your lifespan. Even after you go, the only way someone might remember you would be if you would be able to touch their hearts.

Maybe somebody might not know Carlos Slim, but nobody won’t dare forget Mother Taressa.



So, what should I do ?
Honestly, I don't know!!

But I saw a Dream!
In the dream I saw a place surrounded by lush green mountains, fresh air, cool breeze, far away from the city, corporate world and sheer competition.


A home where all are welcome.
Solve whatever you feel close to your heart.


Learn, Work, Party, Repeat!

A place where ideas become reality not just by competition, but also by cooperation.

A place where engineers, doctors, artists, travellers, musicians, traders, influencers and even executives are welcome to solve real problems and create value. 
And the by-product is monetary benefit.



A place so pure and transparent can only be enabled with a technology that supports it.


I envision a space that creates more value, not just in terms of money, but also improves the happiness quotient, by giving people a chance to see a path other than the rat race.



Rekt CEO is a first step in the direction.
Be rekt or not, BUT Be your own CEO.
Solve whatever you feel close to, help people (small or big), spread happiness, but also be sustainable.


We start the community by bringing back fun and interaction in web3. 
We talk about decentralising the internet, owning our digital creations. 
NFTs are much more than they look at the surface.
These things are not just monkey jpegs, they are a form of representing something unique (Non-Fungible).

We launch rekt ceo with PFP NFTs and Meme NFT limited collection, so that $ceo owners can make their own PFP and memes, while owning them in tokenised assets, while free to hodl or sell/buy/auction it on secondary exchanges.




I welcome my friends, family, and strangers to be part of this lovely dream I imagined, 
Let’s all make money, have fun, and spread happiness and love.








































Version2 (AI edited)


Since childhood, I dreamed of becoming the richest person in the world—a dream I carried with unwavering conviction even through graduation. I can still remember standing before my university peers, boldly declaring this ambition.

But as I reflect on this goal, I realize how little our educational systems teach us about money, despite its profound influence on our lives. We spend our days working for it, saving it, spending it, worrying over it—sometimes even fighting or sacrificing for it. It shapes our status, and too often, it tests our morals.

But is money everything?
Does it truly define who we are?

No.
I believe there is something far more enduring. What truly matters is the impact of our work—the mark we leave on others. Even when we are gone, we live on in the hearts we've touched. Not everyone knows Carlos Slim, but the world will never forget Mother Teresa.

So, what should I do to make my life count?
Honestly, I don’t have all the answers.

But I had a dream—a vivid, almost otherworldly vision.

In my dream:
I found myself in a place nestled among lush, emerald mountains. The air was pure, the breeze refreshing, and everything felt far removed from the relentless pace of city life and corporate competition.

It was a home—open to all.
A sanctuary for anyone driven by passion, curiosity, or kindness.
A place where one could freely explore what mattered most to them.

A perpetual cycle of growth and joy.
Learn. Work. Party. Repeat.


This was not just a haven for one kind of person, but for all:
Engineers, doctors, artists, travelers, musicians, traders, influencers—even business leaders.
A community where ideas flourished not just through competition, but through collaboration and shared purpose.

Here, value is created not just for financial gain, but for genuine happiness—the sort that gives life meaning outside the so-called rat race.

A place so pure, so transparent, could only be powered by revolutionary technology—by systems that empower trust, ownership, and transparency.
As someone who lives and breathes blockchain, I believe only decentralized tech can truly enable such a space.

This is the dream behind Rekt CEO.
Whether you win or get “rekt,” the real challenge is to become the CEO of your own life:
         * Solve problems that matter to you.
         * Support others—whether in small or big ways.
         * Spread happiness.
         * And make sustainability part of the journey.

We start by building a community that restores fun and genuine connection to Web3.
We reimagine what it means to “own” our digital selves, our creativity, and our contributions.

NFTs? They are not just “monkey JPEGs.” They are unique digital expressions—a way to immortalize ideas, jokes, art, and much more.
With Rekt CEO, we launch a collection of limited edition PFP and Meme NFTs, empowering $ceo holders to create, own, and trade their unique online identities and stories.

I invite my friends, family, and even complete strangers to join this beautiful dream.
Let’s innovate, make money, laugh, and most importantly—bring more love and happiness into the world.


Version 3:


I used to have a very simple dream. From the time I was a child until I stood on the edge of adulthood at my graduation, my goal was the same: I wanted to become the richest person in the world. I wasn’t quiet about it. I remember shouting it to my university friends, filled with a certainty that only the young can feel.


Our schools never taught us about money, yet our whole world is built around it. We spend our lives chasing it, worrying about it, and fighting for it. It can build us up, and it can break us down.


But as I got older, a question started to whisper in my mind: Is that all there is? When your story is over, what do people remember? Is it the number in your bank account?


No. I believe what echoes after we are gone is the impact we had on others. True legacy isn't about what you own; it’s about the hearts you touch. The world may forget a rich man’s name, but it will always remember a compassionate soul like Mother Teresa.


Suddenly, my old dream felt hollow. And honestly? I didn’t know what to do next.


Then, a new dream found me.


I saw a place nestled in lush green mountains, where the air was fresh and a cool breeze washed away the noise of the city. It was a place far from the corporate rat race and the constant pressure to compete.


It was a home where everyone was welcome. A place where you could work on whatever problem felt closest to your heart.


Learn. Create. Celebrate. Repeat.


I saw a world where great ideas were born from cooperation, not just competition. A space where engineers, artists, doctors, and dreamers could come together to solve real problems and build things that matter. In this world, making money wasn't the goal—it was the natural result of creating value for others.


A vision so clear and transparent can only be built on a foundation that supports it. I imagine a community that measures its wealth not just in money, but in happiness—by giving people a path to purpose outside the endless race for more.


Rekt CEO is the first step toward making this dream a reality. The name is a philosophy: whether you succeed or get "rekt," you are always the CEO of your own life. It’s about taking control of your path, solving problems you care about, helping others, and building something sustainable and joyful.


We’re starting by bringing fun and real human connection back to the digital world. We talk about decentralizing the internet and truly owning what we create online. Many people see NFTs as just cartoon pictures, but they are much more. They are a powerful way to represent unique ownership of your ideas and creations.


We are launching the Rekt CEO community with a limited collection of PFPs and Memes. This will allow every $CEO owner to create their own identity, own it as a digital asset, and be free to keep, sell, or trade it.


This is the dream I imagined, and it’s too big to build alone. I welcome my friends, my family, and any stranger who feels that same pull in their heart.


Let’s build this place together. Let’s make a living, have fun, and spread happiness and love.

Para Intro
Rekt CEO is a community-driven movement and Web3-native BRAND founded on the ethos of "Learn, Earn and Have Fun," directly challenging the industry's prevalent "Pyramid of Sophisticated Wealth Extraction" where retail often serves as "Exit Liquidity". Our core purpose is solving the "what to do with your coin" problem by creating an ecosystem of products, starting with immediate utility through PFP minter (Collection) and Meme Generator (Collection) NFTs, which are exclusively minted using $CEO tokens to increase demand and accumulate funds in the community treasury. We ensure Tokenized Fairness through a fair launch mechanism and the philosophy of NO Insiders, NO KOLs, and NO Bullshit, positioning every $CEO holder as a co-founder member. This project aims to build a successful PvE memecoin (aka "Cult") that leverages community engagement, turning shared pain ("getting rekt") into a collective comeback story that is governed by an intuitive DAO mechanism planned for future development.

[a]You should write a paragraph on why you call the token "CEO". Why CEO, why not something else?
1 total reaction
Rekt CEO reacted with ❤️ at 2025-07-14 21:25 PM
[b]Statement about why these 2 products were chosen to launch with.
[c]Yes, bullets to explore
- explain NFTs.
- Enable community: fun and engagement
- both products support marketing
[d]how is this enforceable, say I mint a new meme, but it is shared in instagram and others, where is the control? 
Will there be something physically different in the way the media file is encoded?
[e]enforcable according to NFT rules
[f]Does additional liquidity needs to be provided in case if the tokens are being diluted
[g]we'll add an arbitrage bot at backend to profit from Exchange price disparity.
[h]Also Good note: Needs to change this section a bit to current updates
[i]to-do for self:
Check the current staking offers that binance provides to retail users.
[j]We're too small atm
[k]just curious: does this needs to be explicitly shared with the user, and the investors?
[l]NO
[m]Can this create a pandora's box kind of situation, as user then can mint any meme/pfp, even something that may not be socially acceptable.
[n]What will be the liability of CEO in those cases.
[o]This is an open place, they are valid to do anything they may seem fit. We can explicitly NSFW our platform and socials from these content.
[p]idea suggestion: should this community be incentivised to act similar to https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching
[q]Please Explain offline in short
[r]Let's take inspiration from https://www.fernweh.chat/

abhushan sahu reacted with 😶‍🌫️ at 2025-07-16 08:10 AM
[t]what?
[u]Yeah most projects in the ICO phase of 2017 and 2021, launched their projects with a gamification that if users stake their bought tokens, they will unlock more tokens in future (upto 10yr vesting schedules).
Now People realise they bought at overpriced values (rush at launch) and the tokens they earned over years are not even worth that much anymore (less than 10% of original values many times).
[v]So, now instead of startups, looking to launch their own coin on ico, to support the tech. 
They can work on CEO platform, to launch memes, and engage with their communities. while raising money.

[y]can this be combined with lottery/kitty party.
[z]Twitter Games and Spaces (with games) will be fun
[aa]We'll have campaigns and promotional events using QuestN/ Galxe
[ab]thinking out loud:
Considering there are so many issues that the meme coin is reflecting, and small team can never address all these issues. 
How best this team should enable it's investors/users/engagers to build on top of the community, make it modular and pluggable.
[ac]You're in the right direction. 
In an ideal world we would have proper automated DAO which will manage all these things with the help of community.
[ad]i don't understand this image.
[ae]It's okay I can understand.
[af]Simply saying that don't launch meme coin as a zero sum game (rug pulls), someone wins, someone looses.


But make a real community, it's basically everyone winning. 
You ask how? by creating value.


Simple Iterative Game Theory
Everyone cooperates and win wholesome as a society, malicious actors gets kicked out (on assumption, they are less than 1/3 of total population)
Hence don't want big sharks at the start.
[ag]then why did they launch now?
[ah]because it;s a trend game. They want to capitalise it now. Who know till when people will keep using pump fun. 


Trend vanishes... so does their userbase
[ai]What's the timeframe.
[aj]1-2m roughly
[ak]what does it imply? Can people sue?
[al]YES! You can never be sure in these things!
Eg. Darshan Pamle
[am]can you please share some tools that you would recommend.
[an]DEXTools, Dex screener, Birdeye
[ao]I think we need calculation of the valuation, and token distribution at time=0. Based on the bonding curve and whatever platform we choose.
[ap]Let's not do that. 
Overhead time consuming process and calculations. 
(Also not decided with platform)
things will go haywire at launch day.
[aq]Tagging you @abhijaipur2011@gmail.com because I am unable to tag Darshan. 
https://youtu.be/ieND2GmiBi0?t=1269 
Please check this tokenomics model, see if we need to change something
[ar]@sahooankit25@gmail.com @abhijaipur2011@gmail.com  please review
[as]Let;s plan on recruiting a full time intern. The plan is to productise this service. Can print us $$$s.


Need someone who is interested in crypto social media and also in using AI tools.
Entry level Proficiency in either works for me.
[at]I am not sure sure about these expectations. These are very high numbers.
0xppl might not have 5k users in total.
Also we don't want to farm, organic 100 people are more worth 50K farmed ones.
[au]Can we keep the content on this page small and precise. @abhushan.26@gmail.com 
It needs tldr for me atleast 😂
_Assigned to abhushan sahu_
[av]Can remove tmi, and keep briefs
[aw]Let's add interest/ skilled in AI section too.
